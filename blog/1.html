<p>Well for the summer <a href="http://jmatrixlib.sf.net/">MatrixLib</a> is shaping up to be my main project. MatrixLib is a Java library that I am writing for performing a wide spectrum of computations commonly arising in linear algebra. This includes computing determinants, finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, applying modified versions of Gram-Schmidt and Gauss-Jordan, and calculating a number of matrix factorizations, including Singular Value Decomposition and Schur Decomposition. The main benefit to me in undertaking this project is the amount I am learning about efficient matrix computations (which looks like it's turning out to be roughly the equivalent of Cornell's CS 6210 Matrix Computations course) and the experience I am gaining in both designing numerically optimal algorithms and in managing and deploying my project.</p>
<p>MatrixLib is designed to have two main advantages over existing linear algebra software libraries (of which there turn out to be surprisingly few). For one, the Matrix class in Java is designed to support matrices over arbitrary fields. Of particular interest will be doing computations with matrices over the field of complex numbers, for which the ComplexNumber class is provided (although MatrixLib is built to be extensible, so that other field representations can be swapped in for those doing more abstract mathematics).</p>
<p>The other main advantage of MatrixLib is that it is optimized for large matrices (conceivably with thousands of entries or more), which endlessly recur in scientific and engineering scenarios. This is accomplished by holding the design and implementation of the computational algorithms to strict standards of efficiency. Currently, determinants are computed in $$O(n^3)$$ asymptotic time complexity through a modified version of Gauss-Jordan reduction, although this algorithm may be changed to rely on Schur factorization contingent upon the results of performance profiling. Other algorithms are being designed similarly with maximum performance in mind to facilitate calculation with huge matrices. There are plans to implement the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication as well for sufficiently large matrices in order to minimize the amount of operations used in matrix multiplication.</p>
<p>After working on MatrixLib for about a month, I estimate that I am roughly halfway to where I want to be for a first release. Design decisions geared towards increased numerical stability and interface intuitiveness are still being tweaked, and I will continue to discuss these at depth on this site. In the meantime, the easiest way to follow along with MatrixLib development is to keep up with the public GitHub repository, which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/BCuccioli/MatrixLib">https://github.com/BCuccioli/MatrixLib</a>.</p>
