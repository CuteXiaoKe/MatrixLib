<p>One technique in matrix computation that has turned out to be useful in many cases is that of applying Householder transformations to a matrix. A Householder transformation reflects a vector or column of a matrix across a plane through the origin. In particular, if the plane is defined by an orthogonal unit vector $$v$$, the reflection of a vector $$x$$ about that plane is $$x-2\langle v,x\rangle v$$, and the Householder transformation is a linear transformation represented by the involution $$P=I-2vv^H$$.</p>
<p>The Householder transformation is a similarity transformation and thus preserves the important properties of a matrix, such as its spectrum. Because of this key feature, a wise first step in computing eigenvalues is to transform the matrix through Householder reflections to upper Hessenberg form (the matrix has zeros below the first subdiagonal; $$a_{ij}=0$$ if $$i>j+1$$. When a Hessenberg matrix is iterated in the QR algorithm, it will converge much more quickly - these steps will be detailed later.</p>
<p>Converting a matrix $$A$$ to upper Hessenberg form through Householder reflections is a simple process. For each column, let $$X_i$$ be the matrix that has had a Householder reflection applied to that column. Construct $$U_i$$ by padding $$X_i$$ left and above with a column and row of zeros, and set $$U_{0,0}=1$$. Then compute the similarity transform $$A := U^{-1}AU$$ and reiterate. Each of these iterations will change all of the entries in the given column of the original matrix below the first subdiagonal to zero.</p>
<p>Householder reflections are also needed to compute the QR decomposition of a matrix, which writes a matrix as a product of a unitary matrix and an upper triangular matrix. Computing the QR decomposition requires computing orthonormal sets of vectors, and the method of applying Householder transformations to orthogonalize the vectors is preferable to using the Gram-Schmidt process as it is more numerically stable. Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition#Using_Householder_reflections">details this process in full</a>.</p>
<p>Next time we will discuss applying these transformations as the building blocks towards the shifted QR algorithm, a powerful algorithm for computing the eigenvalues of a matrix.</p>
